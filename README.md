## WooCommerce Company Portals

WooCommerce Company Portals extends WooCommerce Companies, adding functionality to provide Company specific pricing and Company Portals (Archives).

## How it works

WooCommerce Side Cart adds a post link when view the Companies post type.

![Example 1](screenshots/example-1.png?raw=true "Example 1")

By click on the post link 'Generate Company Portal', a new term is created in the Company Portal taxonomy.

![Example 2](screenshots/example-2.png?raw=true "Example 2")

You can assign this Company Portal to any Product as normal.

![Example 3](screenshots/example-3.png?raw=true "Example 3")

Once a Company Portal is assigned, when editing the Product you will be able to set the Regular and Sale price for each Company Portal.

![Example 4](screenshots/example-4.png?raw=true "Example 4")

When viewing the Company Portal you will see the products in the archive, along with the prices assigned. From here you can add the product the Cart and the price will stick.

![Example 5](screenshots/example-5.png?raw=true "Example 5")

The Company Portal link is only accessible to Users assigned to the Company (via their Profile) and Admins.
